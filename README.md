# MovieSoftware

This was a program I had to make for a University project where there is two guis one thats for the client and one thats for the company which is the server gui.
I had to use SQL as my Database and SQL coding language to set it up aswell.

This program is designed for a client to login into the database and search for any movie they would like and gain its information.
There is an admin side aswell that if the client were to be an admin at a movie store and wanted to add more movies or even delete movies they could.

I learned alot during this project but for me these were the key things
  - I learned how to setup a client and server connection that can handle multiple connections
  - I learned how to setup a database that someone can access through a GUI using sqljdbc

Another important thing to note is although this was a University project I never had a lecturer so I am self taught mostly.
